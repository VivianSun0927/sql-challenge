# SQL Challenge
In this challenge we are simulating a scenario where we are a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Our task is to launch a research project into seeing which employees where hired by the company within the years 1980-1990s. We will be working with provided CSV files in which we will perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis based on a set of questions regarding the data.
